# Order Fulfillment Process Optimization

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and optimize the order fulfillment process for an e-commerce dataset. Using Python for data cleaning and preprocessing, Excel (Power Query) for data preparation, and Power BI (with DAX) for building interactive dashboards, the project delivers actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Motivation
Efficient order fulfillment is critical for e-commerce success. Delays or bottlenecks in shipping and delivery impact customer experience and business costs. This project demonstrates a real-world approach to process improvement using data analytics and visualization tools.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: E-Commerce Order Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (provide exact link when you decide). It contains order dates, shipping dates, delivery dates, customer and product details, and status indicators.

## Tech Stack
- **Python:** pandas, numpy for data cleaning and feature engineering
- **Excel:** Power Query for data preparation and inspection
- **Power BI:** Dashboard creation with DAX calculations and visualizations
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Excel, Power BI Desktop
